      <h3>Invited Speakers</h3>
      <p><strong><a name="fraser"></a>Gordon Fraser</strong> is a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, UK. He received a PhD in computer science from Graz University of Technology, Austria, in 2007. The central theme of his research is improving software quality, and his recent research concerns the prevention, detection, and removal of defects in software. More specifically, he develops techniques to generate test cases automatically using search-based and constraint-based approaches, and to guide the tester in validating the output of tests by producing test oracles and specifications, for example using mutation analysis.

      <p><strong><a name="williams"></a>James Williams</strong> is a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of York, UK, from where he also he received his PhD. His PhD research focused on devising an encoding for MDE models that enables metaheuristic search techniques to be applied to MDE problems. For instance, one could use the encoding to automatically search for an appropriate set of models to test a model transformation. James currently works on the OSSMETER EU STREP project, where he is responsible for developing a platform for applying metric analysis to open-source software projects, with the ultimate aim of assessing, comparing and improving their quality.Website: <a href="http://www.jamesrobertwilliams.co.uk/about.htm">http://www.jamesrobertwilliams.co.uk</a></p>
